Peach Blossoms at Big Forest Temple


人间四月芳菲尽 
山寺桃花如盛开 
长恨春归无觅处 
不知转入此中来	
With people, four months -- and the fragrance is gone. 
But the peaches at this hill temple are just beginning to blossom. 
I've worried over spring's return, over not finding my right place. 
Now, somehow I've changed -- and ended up here.
